<p class="hik-p1">Situated a few kilometres north of the main Hikkaduwa town lies the Sea Turtle Hatchery and Rescue Centre, 
  a centre with the aim of conserving some of the endangered species of turtles in the world. 
  It is just one of many turtle hatcheries in the southern coast of the island. 
  Initially starting as a community project to help protect the biodiversity of the southern coast, 
  it is now a fully-fledged hatchery and rescue centre with dedicated teams that work round the clock to study, 
  care and protect several turtle species.<br>
                                                                                                                      
  Presently, there are<a href="categories.html"> five species of turtles </a> that are taken care of in the hatchery and rescue centre. 
    Such species are the <a href="categories.html"> Olive Ridley Turtle, Leatherback Turtle, Loggerhead Turtle, Hawksbill Turtle, and Green Turtle.</a>
          The facilities of the sea turtle hatchery and rescue centre are all state-of-the-art, complete with water tanks to care for newborn turtles, 
    along with adult turtle species that have been rescued from the sea due to injuries. 
    One of the more peculiar sights in the centre is the area in which the turtles lay their eggs, 
    as they have distinct little mounds of sand piled neatly between one another. 
    Each of these mounds is monitored closely to calculate the hatching process of the turtle eggs.
    Regrettably, visitors will also be able to see turtles with mutilated bodily parts sadly, for instance without forelegs or hind legs . 
    This bodily harm is normally afflicted by boat engines. Once they lose one of their limbs, 
    turtles get off balance and it takes quite some time till they recover in order to have full body command the same as prior to the accident. 
    This is why this farm is also considered to be a unique shelter that helps disabled turtles to find their body balance and sustain their lives.<br>

   <p id="hik-p2">Hikkaduwa is a sea resort town in Sri Lanka, 
      centring around the ideal beach holiday idea. 
      Hikkaduwa's weather rarely witnesses varying temperatures.
       Given the levels of humidity and warm temperatures with a chance of rainfall through most parts of the year,
        Hikkaduwa is less temperate in comparison to other tourist destinations, about 4% from a perspective of pleasant weather conditions. 
        The hottest period to visit Hikkaduwa is May, April and then March, with the maximum temperature being approx. 31.8°C in the day in the early part of May and the minimum being 26.1°C in the night.
<br>
      With some extremely humid months, 
      Hikkaduwa experiences a high volume of stickiness through the year with the least level of humidity in March and maximum in July. 
      The winds in this part of the country are usually calm with the breeze being at its peak in June, July and May. The busiest time for tourism is in December, followed by October and then August,
       with less or no traffic in June.

    <img src="images/surfing.jpg" id="hikim2">
   <p id="hik-p2"> Surfing is one of the most popular things to engage in Hikkaduwa,
       with a clear warm water base and waves as high as 11 ft. 
       With a high-performance wave and an A-frame peak which has a considerable line running through to the shore, 
       with a left break into a channel with the choicest mix of sand and reef, 
       the main reef at Hikkaduwa is mostly crowded in favorable conditions. <br>
       Approx. 200 m south of the main reef is Benny's which favors the left and is must faster and hollower than the main reef.

      You will find the best surf in the resort town during the dry season of November through March at the four major surf sports in Hikkaduwa. 
      The adaptable and diverse selection of tides in this area includes some beach breaks as well and you will find Madiha, 
      one of the best surfing spots in Sri Lanka on the south of Hikkaduwa.</p>
