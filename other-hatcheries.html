      <h4 id="o-h4">Rekawa Turtle Beach</h4>
      <img id="o-picture" src="images/rekwawe.jpg" width="100%" height="360px">
      <p id="o-para">Rekawa beach is not only one of the best places to spot sea turtles only in Sri Lanka but also in the world. 
        In Rekawa you can observe the ancient ritual of turtles coming ashore and laying eggs. 
        Rekawa beach is visited by five different species of sea turtles, 
        which lay their eggs in the sand every night throughout the year.<br>

        There are many places in Sri Lanka where you can check on endangered sea turtles, starting from Kalutara, 
        Bentota all the way up to the deep south there are dozens of sea turtle conservation farms. 
        Usually, these sea turtle conservation centres are visited by foreign tourists and are a part of most Sri Lanka road trips. 
        The tourists should pay for the entrance to these centres and it is the main income of the sea turtle conservation centres.<br>
        
        The sea turtles are restricted to big tanks in all these places and their movement is restricted. 
        But, unlike all these man-made sea turtle conservation centres, In Rekawa sea turtles are totally free, 
        with no human intervention with their activities. Maybe that' s the reason why so many sea turtles are coming to Rekawa beach for nesting.</p>

    <div class="o-name">
      <h4 id="o-h4">Turtle Bay Activity Center</h4>
      <img id="o-picture" src="images/turtle bay.jpg"  width="100%" height="360px">
      <p id="o-para">Turtle Bay Hotel's location in the south of Sri Lanka features the largest population of turtles on the island. 
        Inspired and touched by the many species of turtle nesting there each year, 
        the hotel chose to honour these beautiful creatures by including them in the hotel's name.<br>

        Of the 7 sea turtle species in existence today, sadly all are considered endangered or critically endangered. 
        5 out of these 7 species, the green turtle, the hawksbill turtle, 
        the loggerhead turtle, the Oliver Ridley turtle and the leatherback turtle, visit Sri Lanka's southern coastal belt for nesting.
         Of these, the leatherback turtle is the largest and rarest of turtles species in Sri Lankan waters.
        
        In honour and respect of these beautiful creatures, our rooms at the hotel are named after them.
        
        One of the most magical and curious things about these creatures is how female adult sea turtles always return to nest at the very beach they were born at. 
        This remarkable homecoming first starts when they reach about 25 years of age and continues until their breeding days are done. 
        As far as we know, this has been a sea turtle tradition since the beginning of time.<br>

    <h4 id="o-h4">Sea Turtle Farm & Hatchery Koggala</h4>
    <img id="o-picture" src="images/Koggala.jpg"  width="100%" height="360px">
    <p id="parakog">Koggala is rapidly becoming a luxury holiday destination and the list of things to do in Koggala, 
      Sri Lanka is ever growing. Popular day trips in the area include cruises along the serene Koggala Lake, 
      leisurely hours on the beach and even visits to the Koggala sea turtle hatchery and farm.
       In truth, nothing beats seeing turtles swim freely in their natural habitat but since they are endangered, 
       it doesn't hurt to visit a sanctuary.<br> 
       Turtle sanctuaries such as the one in Koggala are doing their part to save these mysterious sea creatures from extinction.

      <br>
      The staff at Koggala Sea Turtle farm and hatchery rescues injured or disabled sea turtles to care for them and buy turtle eggs from poachers to save the hatchlings. 
      Visitors to the farm can take part in releasing baby turtles into the sea. Injured turtles find a permanent home at the farm as they are unlikely to survive in the wild depths of the sea. 
      While their intentions seem to be genuine, certain practices such as letting visitors touch the turtles can be a little off-putting. On the plus side, the staff seems to be knowledgeable about turtles and you can learn a lot about this gentle species at the farm.
