    <p id="para1">The Bentota Turtle Hatchery Project is a popular attraction in Bentota, 
      Sri Lanka.
       The project aims to conserve and protect the eggs of up to five endangered species of turtles from predators and other dangers.
       <br>
        The turtles are allowed to hatch and thrive in a protected area before being set free. The turtle hatchery is one of 18 turtle hatcheries along the southern coast of Sri Lanka.The Kosgoda Sea Turtle Conservation Center, 
        located in the South Western coastal village of Kosgoda, 
        is one of the must-visit places in Bentota during a Sri Lanka tour. It was established in 1981 and is one of the 18 hatcheries in Sri Lanka devoted to the proper breeding of this endangered species. 
      Visitors can get to see up to five endangered species out of seven species of margin turtles in the world here.</p>

       <p id="para2">Turtle Hatchery was started by the Sri Lankans with a view to protect the turtles
         from extinction. Earlier, people usually fishermen used to collect the turtleâ€™s eggs 
         and sold it to whoever would pay the higher price. With the commencement of the Turtle Hatchery 
         these eggs were fed and cared for until they were 2 to 4 years old. You can find different species 
         of turtles such as Green Turtle, Leatherback and Olive Ridley. Despite their extinction turtles are
         still caught by the fishermen for fish and shells which is indeed a very lucrative market.</p>

        <div class="para3">
      Visitors to the hatcheries can often observe the turtles at 
        different stages of their life cycle, from eggs to hatchlings and even larger juvenile or adult turtles.
         The staff at these hatcheries provide valuable information about the different turtle species, 
        their nesting habits, and the challenges they face in the wild.
      </div>
      <div class="para3">
        Additionally, some hatcheries in Bentota also engage in turtle rescue and rehabilitation efforts. 
        They rescue injured or sick turtles, provide necessary medical care, and rehabilitate them before releasing them back into the ocean.
        These turtle hatcheries serve as important centers for turtle conservation,
         raising awareness about the threats faced by these magnificent creatures and promoting responsible 
         tourism practices. 
         Visitors can learn about the importance of protecting sea turtles and how they 
         can contribute to their conservation efforts.
